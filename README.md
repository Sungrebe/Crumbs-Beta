TrailCrumbs is an app that will allow you to navigate in remote areas without getting lost. As you walk, the app will plot a virtual trail of "crumbs", inspired by the folktale of Hansel and Gretel. Unlike their breadcrumbs, these virtual crumbs don't get eaten :-) If you are lost, you can follow the virtual crumbs back to your starting location. The black dot marks your starting location, while the red dot represents your current location. This app works without an internet connection (it just uses geolocation) so you can use it in remote areas.

TrailCrumbs beta currently has:
- The ability to create a new route
- You can take pictures using the TrailCrumbs camera while walking
- You can save routes

Above: When you first start the app, you would not have created any routes, so the save routes tab would be empty.

Above: This is what the process of trail plotting looks like. Remember, the red dot is at your current location, while the black dot is at your
starting location. To end trail plotting, click "Stop Recording". While you are plotting, you may take pictures using the camera tab (not shown here because these preview images were being run on an iOS Simulator, which does not have a camera feature)

Above: When you end the trail plotting, a pop-up displays so that you can save the trail. To save, give the trail a unique name (otherwise the default name is "Untitled Trail"). Then, click the save button, or the cancel button if you wish to discard the route.

When you save the trail, it will show up in your saved routes along with some information about the trail name and duration. If you click on the saved trail card, you can see additional information, such as the images you took while walking and a picture of the route.
